Wish I would never have said it
But if only admit it
And I will tell you the truth
cause that's all I know - so
pathetic
So you can't ignore how he
bought you
He sat you down and he taught
you
And you'll obey every rule that
he made
Cause he bought you, now he owns
you
So don't go away, don't go away
I got something to say about the
dark side of me
Dead side of me, light side of
me
Dark side of me, dead side of me
I lied to you and you caught me
I shoulda learned what you
taught me
And the truth cuts just like a
knife,
When you cut me
And I'll do all that I told you
I love you and I would hold you
But those are just things that I
said in my head
But she told you, should have
told you
I said don't go away, don't go
away
Got something to say about the
dark side of me
Dead side of me, light side of
me
Dark side of me, dead side of me
Just let me be, what I want to
be
I said I haven't told you
anything
I hold it all inside in vain
I think of you and I think of
pain
Now I've told you everything
I said don't go away, don't go
away
I got something to say about the
dark side of me
I said I haven't told you
anything
Dead side of me
I hold it all inside in vain
Light side of me
I think of you and I think of
pain
Dark side of me
Now I've told you everything
Dead side of me
I said I haven't told you
anything
I hold it all inside in vain
I think of you and I think of
pain
I never tell you anything
I said I haven't told you
anything
I hold it all inside in vain
I think of you and I think of
pain
Never said it, so forget it.
